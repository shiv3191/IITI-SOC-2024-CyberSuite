<h1>Cybersecurity Suite for Enhanced Digital Security</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This cybersecurity suite comprises three essential tools designed to enhance digital security: Password Checker, Malicious Mail Identifier, and Keylogger. Each tool is crafted to address specific security vulnerabilities and ensure a safer digital environment.

This cybersecurity suite comprising the following tools:
<h2>● Malicious Mail Identifier:</h2>
We Create an email scanning tool capable of identifying potentially malicious emails. The tool should analyse email headers, content, and attachments to detect phishing attempts, malware, and suspicious links.

<h2>● Password Checker:</h2>
We Develop a tool that checks the strength of passwords entered by users. The tool should evaluate factors such as length, complexity, and inclusion of special characters to determine the strength of a password.





<h2>● Keylogger:</h2>
We Build a tool that can capture user keyboard inputs via keys pressed by the user and use it to retrieve sensitive data by making a clone of the login page of a famous website and then using that to take input of users.
